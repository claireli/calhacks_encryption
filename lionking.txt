 [THE CIRCLE OF LIFE]

 [  MS: Male Singer
    BS: Background Singer
    FS: Female Singer (lead) ]

 {Sunrise on African grassland (lightly treed), in time with
 opening chant to The Circle of Life}

 MS: Nants ingonyama bagithi Baba     [Here comes a lion, Father] 

 BS: Sithi uhm ingonyama            [Oh yes, it's a lion]

 {Various shots of animals raising their heads at the sunrise:
 rhinos, antelope, a cheetah, meerkats, storks...}

 MS: Nants ingonyama bagithi Baba     [Here comes a lion, Father] 

 BS: Sithi uhhmm ingonyama            [Oh yes, it's a lion]

     Ingonyama

 MS: Siyo Nqoba                       [We're going to conquer]

 BS: Ingonyama
     Ingonyama nengw' enamabala       [A lion and a leopard come to this open place]
     {repeats 5}

     Ingonyama nengw' enamabala (Asana)
     {repeats 1}

 {The Circle of Life ground forms in the BS's and holds its
 pattern for eight bars. It is a non-chordal BS part. The
 progressions are in the medium ranges of the strings.
 Various pans and camera views of African animals, all
 moving. Coinciding with the FS pickup in the eighth bar,
 we first view the giraffes, panning to a long shot of all
 the animals in their procession}

 [The Circle of life text]

 FS: From the day we arrive on the planet
     And, blinking, step into the sun
     There's more to see than can ever be seen
     More to do than can ever be done

 {Camera is panning and jumping to elephants, zebras, ants,
 birds, storks, etc... }

     There's far too much to take in here
     More to find than can ever be found
     But the sun rolling high
     Through the sapphire sky
     Keeps great and small on the endless round

 {When the "The Circle of Life" is mentioned the long-
 distance pan centers on Pride Rock where all the animals
 are gathering. Mufasa is on Pride Rock. Long camera arc to
 Mufasa and Zazu.}

     It's the Circle of Life
     And it moves us all

 {Zazu bows to Mufasa, who smiles and nods at him}

     Through despair and hope
     Through faith and love

 {Appearance of Rafiki, the mandrill. He passes between
 ranks of animals, who bow to him; he then climbs Pride Rock
 to where Mufasa is standing.}

     Till we find our place
     On the path unwinding

 {Rafiki and Mufasa embrace.}

     In the Circle
     The Circle of Life

 {Decrescendo in BS. FS drops out. Pan Flute takes simple
 lead.}

 {Mufasa leads Rafiki over to Sarabi, who is holding Simba}

 {Rafiki puts the juice and sand he collects on Simba's
 brow-- a ceremonial crown. He then picks Simba up and
 ascends to the point of Pride Rock. Mufasa and Sarabi
 follow. With a crescendo in the music and a restatement of
 the refrain, Rafiki holds Simba up for the crowd to view.}

 FS: It's The Circle of Life

 {The crowd starts howling, stamping, etc... }

     And it moves us all
     Through despair and hope
     Through faith and love

 {The clouds part and a sunbeam highlights Rafiki and Simba
 on Pride Rock.}

     Till we find our place

 {The crowd bows down, one by one.}

     On the path unwinding

 {Camera slowly zooms out to a striking panoramic view
 of the Presentation.}

     In the Circle
     The Circle of Life

 {Bass drum hit (fff) and immediate switch to black screen
 with title "The Lion King" in blood-red caps.}

 [Mouse / Challenge Scene]

 {Cue mouse sounds}

 {Visual fade into mouse in cave}

 {Mouse comes out and starts preening in the light. Begins
 sniffing. Becomes frightened. Suddenly a large lion paw
 swoops down and catches him.}

 {Cue the Scar theme (dissonant, slow, reed theme). Fade in
 slowly and up full during speech}

 {Camera switch to Scar holding the squeaking and
 struggling mouse in his paw. He talks to it while playing
 with it}

 Scar: Life's not fair, is it? You see I -- well, I... shall
     never be King. {exhale lightly} And you... shall never
     see the light of another day. {closed-mouth laughter.
     Starts to place the mouse on his extended tongue} ...
     Adieu... {quiet laugh}

 Zazu : {Interrupting} Didn't your mother ever tell you not
     to play with your food?

 Scar: {Light sigh. The mouse is under his paw.} What do you want?

 Zazu: I'm here to announce that King Mufasa is on his way. {bows}
     ...So you'd better have a good excuse for missing the
     ceremony this morning.

 {The mouse runs away from Scar}

 Scar: Oh now look, Zazu; you've made me lose my lunch.

 Zazu: Hah! You'll lose more than that when the King gets
     through with you. He's as mad as a hippo with a
     hernia.

 Scar: Oooh... I quiver with FEAR.

 {On "FEAR" Scar crouches down and is baring his teeth at
 Zazu.}

 Zazu: {Very concerned} Now Scar, don't look at me that
     way... HELP!

 {Scar quickly pounces on the bird, catching him in his mouth.}

 Mufasa: {Almost immediately and off-camera} Scar! ...

 Scar: {Mouth full} Mm-hmm?

 Mufasa: Drop him.

 Zazu: {Speaking from Scar's mouth} Impeccable timing, your
     majesty.

 {Scar spits the bird out, covered with saliva}

 Zazu: {Slimed} Eyyccch.

 Scar: {Sarcastically overjoyed} Why! If it isn't my big
     brother descending from on high to mingle with the
     commoners.

 Mufasa: Sarabi and I didn't see you at the presentation of
     Simba.

 Scar: {Faking astonishment} That was today? Oh, I feel
     simply awful.

 {He turns and start scraping his claws on the rock wall.
 Zazu cringes at the sound.}

 Scar: {Admiring his claws} ...Must have slipped my mind.

 Zazu: Yes, well, as slippery as your mind is, as the king's
     brother, you should have been first in line!

 {Scar clicks his teeth at Zazu, who has flown near his
 face. Zazu takes cover behind Mufasa's foreleg. Scar bends
 down to speak to him.}

 Scar: Well, I was first in line... until the little hairball
     was born.
